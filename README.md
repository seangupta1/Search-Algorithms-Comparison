# Search-Algorithms-Comparison
An experiment comparing the performance of linear, sentinel, binary, and ternary search algorithms.

## Overview
This project compares the performance of four search algorithms implemented in Python:  
**Linear Search**, **Sentinel Search**, **Binary Search**, and **Ternary Search**.  

The goal is to **analyze average-case performance** by counting the number of comparisons for different input sizes.

## Experiment
1. Implemented all four algorithms in Python.  
2. Measured the number of comparisons for input sizes: `1,000; 5,000; 10,000; 50,000; 100,000`.  
3. Repeated each experiment **five times** with randomly generated arrays of numbers between 0 and 1000.  
4. Results are visualized using **tables and line charts** for easy comparison.
